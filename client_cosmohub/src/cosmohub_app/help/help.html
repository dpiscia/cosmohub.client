About
=====

CosmoHUB was first thought as a tool to share information within the [Physics of the Accelerated Universe ](http://www.pausurvey.org/home-PAU.html) (PAU) project, which is a cosmological survey designed to study the existence and properties of dark energy.

This service is hosted by the [Port d'Informació Científica](http://www.pic.es/) (PIC), which is a data center of excellence for scientific-data processing.

Nowadays, we provide support to four international cosmological projects:

* [The Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) (DES)

* [Euclid Consortium](http://www.euclid-ec.org/) (Euclid)

* [The Physics of the Accelerated Universe](http://www.pausurvey.org/home-PAU.html) (PAU)

* [The Marenostrum Institut de Ciències de l'Espai Simulations](http://maia.ice.cat/mice/) (MICE) 

Most data are galaxy catalogs which are usually stored in a **relational database**.

CosmoHUB users can access all public data and also the data that belong to their project membership.

Inside each catalog you may find **Value-added data** ready to download. For example, specific subsets of the galaxy catalog (e.g. LRG sample) or complementary data (e.g. masks). A description of the Value-added data is provided through an attached README file.

Another interesting feature of this service is that users can create their own **custom catalogs** through a guided process. In case you are familiar with SQL language, you can even write your own queries. In addition, there is also the possibility to **preview and plot** in real-time a sample of your custom catalog.
